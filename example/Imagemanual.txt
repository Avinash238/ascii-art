"""
This script demonstrates how to read an image using Python and the Pillow library.

1. Import the Pillow library, which provides image processing capabilities.

2. Open an image file ('your_image.jpg' in this example) using the Image.open() method.

3. The 'image' object now represents the image file and can be used for various operations.

4. You can display the image using the 'show()' method (commented out).

5. To get the dimensions (width x height) of the image, use the 'size' attribute.

6. Access pixel data using the 'getpixel()' method at specified coordinates (x, y).

7. Convert the image to grayscale if needed using the 'convert()' method (commented out).

8. Save the modified image using the 'save()' method (commented out).

9. Close the image file using the 'close()' method to free up system resources.

Feel free to modify and use this script to work with images in your projects.
